# RoboticsCompiler
A simple compiler that converts natural text into robotics code

This simple compiler seeks to allow for an intuitive solution to 3pi robotics, maze-traversing oriented,
programmming by allowing the user to follow a very basic syntax in order to get the user accustomed to writing instructions
and immediately seeing the results.

TODO:
Allow the compiler to create a main.c file
Upload the main.c file to a 3pi robot
